              <p>Close to the end of each year, music publications like <a href="https://pitchfork.com">Pitchfork</a>, <a href="https://rollingstone.com">Rolling Stone</a>, and <a href="https://pastemagazine.com">Paste Magazine</a> publish lists of their staff's favourite songs of the year.

              <h1>The best songs of 2018</h1>
              <h3>"Loading Zones"</h3> 
              <h4>KURT VILE</h4>
               <p><img src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5bad041ab5a62d2d54af5e68/1:1/w_320/kurt%20vile_bottle%20it%20in.jpg" alt="Album cover: Kurt Vile - Bottle It In" style="width:100px;height:100px;" align="left">“Loading Zones”, the lead single from Vile’s new album Bottle It In is easily a career highlight for the indie-folk singer. Though Vile’s music has typically sounded slow and hazy, “Loading Zones” is fast-paced and electric. Vile recently compared his new album to Bruce Springsteen’s 1984 class Born in the U.S.A. The comparison is clear on this track: Vile’s playful lyrics, about avoiding traffic tickets in Philadelphia, evokes the songwriting of Springsteen’s most thrilling tracks.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
              <h3>"Space Cowboy"</h3> 
              <h4>KACEY MUSGRAVES</h4>
              <p><img src="https://img.discogs.com/zbnc8QNf1AnTW7PF-sauIAC-jCQ=/fit-in/600x600/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/R-11960013-1525524294-2732.jpeg.jpg" alt="Album cover: Kacey Musgraves - Golden Hour" style="width:100px;height:100px;" align="left">Musgraves has long been hailed as a country singer for people who don’t like country music. She’s unafraid to think outside of the box, both in terms of writing and production. On cinematic ballad “Space Cowboy”, Musgraves sings about a galaxy-spanning heartbreak. The track’s emotional intensity is complemented by slick production, including a Prince-esque guitar solo during the song’s bridge.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
              <h3>"Me and Michael"</h3> 
              <h4>MGMT</h4>
              <p><img src="https://img.discogs.com/Hv9OFKz56nlcpjx5EHf-o-c6jOk=/fit-in/600x585/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/R-11555059-1518581674-9986.jpeg.jpg" alt="Album cover: MGMT - Little Dark Age" style="width:100px;height:100px;" align="left">After MGMT’s lackluster 2013 self-titled album, the electronic duo took time off to strengthen their sound. “Me and Michael” is an undeniably catchy synth-pop track that captures that strength. The lyrics, at first glance, seem to portray an unbreakable friendship, but songwriter Andrew VanWyngarden admitted earlier this year that the song’s lyrics have no particular meaning.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
              <h3>"Nobody"</h3> 
              <h4>MITSKI</h4>
              <p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2337835939_10.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;" alt="Album cover: Mitski - Be The Cowboy" align="left">If Mitski’s songs form the soundtrack to self-destructive emotional behaviour, “Nobody” should accompany the shrieking laughter one has after they give up. “Nobody” has one depressing lyric after another, with Mitski singing about profound loneliness. But the song’s bouncy synths and off-kilter key change make that loneliness sound like a rollercoaster.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
              <h3>"Miki Dora"</h3> 
              <h4>AMEN DUNES</h4>
              <p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/popbollocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AMEN-DUNES-FREEDOM-ALBUM-COVER.jpg?resize=720%2C720&ssl=1" alt="Album cover: Amen Dunes - Freedom" style="width:100px;height:100px;" align="left">The highlight from Amen Dunes’ breakthrough record Freedom is “Miki Dora”, a song that Dunes admits is named after a controversial figure from the 1950s. Dora was a heroic surfer who served a prison sentence for fraud and had a mean streak. Dunes uses Dora’s story as a template to sing about regret and insincerity over laid-back, surf-rock riffs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
              <h3>"Disaffectation"</h3> 
              <h4>OUGHT</h4>
              <p><img src="https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2018/02/ought-cover-1518532721-640x640.png" alt="Album cover: Ought - Room Inside The World" style="width:100px;height:100px;" align="left">Montreal punk band Ought creates a panicked, chaotic environment with most of their songs, but lead singer Tim Darcy’s distinct voice soothes it all out. On “Disaffectation”, they use a palette of chirpy synths and booming percussion to create a track that shifts between tempos. The track sounds like it should accompany a Scooby-Doo chase: it’s goofy and cartoonish, but still a chase.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
              <h3>"Hunger"</h3> 
              <h4>FLORENCE AND THE MACHINE</h4>
              <p><img src="https://static.spin.com/files/2018/06/600-1530200413-compressed.jpg" alt="Album cover: Florence and the Machine - High as Hope" style="width:100px;height:100px;" align="left">“Hunger” may alienate fans due to its commercial appeal, but the song is impossible not to sing – or scream – along to. Florence Welch’s powerhouse vocals echo the obsession that “Hunger” describes, and the song’s plucky synths provide the perfect backdrop for that obsession.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
              <h3>"Come Up With Me"</h3> 
              <h4>GUERILLA TOSS</h4>
              <p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0172212971_10.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;" alt="Album cover: Guerilla Toss - Twisted Crystal" align="left">Guerilla Toss, stemming from Boston, makes psychedelic punk that’s both modern and nostalgic. “Come Up With Me” is one of their best tracks. It’s fast-paced guitar riffs and arcade-inspired synths twist around each other and become tangled up, and lead singer Kassie Carlson makes invites the listener to get lost in that jumble of sound.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
