He graduated from Algonquin College’s Journalism program in 2017.</p>
            <p>Morris has written for several publications in the past three years, including the <a href="https://www.thewhig.com/">Kingston Whig-Standard</a> and the <a href="http://orleansonline.ca/">Orleans Star</a>. In 2016-17, he was on the editorial staff for <a href="https://gluemagazine.com">Glue Magazine</a>, which is Ottawa’s exclusive student magazine. He has also worked in Algonquin College’s marketing department.</p>
            <p>Morris was born in Hamilton, ON, in 1996. He grew up in Texas and Washington State, before moving to Ottawa in 2005 where he has lived since. Morris believes in astrology – ironically, of course – and is a proud Scorpio. When he’s not working or studying, he can be found watching Judge Judy or Dateline NBC.</p>
